# **Diary**

---

**Diary** is a robust personal journaling platform built with Laravel that allows users to create, manage, and publish their notes within individual subdomains. This application demonstrates subdomain-based multi-tenancy architecture with Laravel, providing each user with their own personalized space at their subdomain. Users can create, publish, and delete notes, with published notes appearing on both the main welcome page and the user's subdomain welcome page. Guest users can also view published notes without authentication.

The platform includes authentication features powered by **Laravel Breeze**, allowing users to register themselves with a unique subdomain. This project was built to test and demonstrate knowledge of multi-tenancy, subdomain routing, and CRUD operations in Laravel.
